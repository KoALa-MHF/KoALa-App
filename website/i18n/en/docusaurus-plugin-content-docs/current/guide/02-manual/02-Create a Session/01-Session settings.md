# Session settings {#guide-first-steps-session-settings}

In the session settings you will first find the general information. Here you can change the name of the session and the session description. The description is an additional detail and can e.g. contain an exercise for the participants.

Next, you will find the sessionâ€™s functions. Here you can set which functions should be available or visible to the participants. These settings can also be flexibly changed in the session under **Releases**.

1. Editing: Generally, the session can only be edited when the audio player is playing. If no audio is played, the markers turn gray and can no longer be used. This also happens when you disable editing. This is useful, for example, when you want to listen to the audio with the participants, but no editing should take place yet.
2. Player: If you have disabled the player, the audio only comes from your device, the participants cannot play any sound on their device but if editing is allowed they can set annotations. If you activate the player, the participants can control the player themselves and the audio plays on their respective devices.
3. Sample solution: If you activate the sample solution, you can set your own marker annotations as a sample solution that will then be displayed to the participants in the evaluation screen. It is recommended to activate the release only after the annotations. In addition, the evaluation must also be activated for this.
4. Evaluation: If you activate the evaluation, the participants can see and compare their annotations and the annotations of the other participants. You can edit which annotations should be shown to the participants. Here too, it is recommended to activate the evaluation screen only after the annotations.
5. Lock Deletion of Annotations: If the deletion of the annotations is permitted, the participants can delete their annotations by crossing at the end of a marker's line. If deletion is blocked, this is no longer possible. It is advisable to block deletion, for example, if you want to capture a spontaneous first impression or use the session for an exam.

Finally, you can edit the availability of the session. Only when the session is _online_ users can access it. If not, the session is only visible to you as an administrator. You can set the status to _Under construction_, _Online_, _Closed_ and _Archived_. You can also specify a start and end date. During this period, participants can join the session. N.B.: During the editing period, the status must always be set manually to _Online_.
