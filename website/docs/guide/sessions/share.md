# Share a Session
Once the key parameters of a Session are all set up, you might want to invete people to join the Session. KoALa provides several possibilites that are made for different use cases.

## Invite Participants

You have multiple possibilities to invite participants to a Session.

### 1. You know all participants and you have their eMail addresses (usually classroom setting)
If you know their eMail addresses, you can invite them via Mail. A personalised link will be sent to them. The advantage is that participants can come back to the Session with their personal link and have access to ther annotations immediately.

### 2. You have a mixed group (e.g. with people from several institution)
You can share a single link with your participants. They will be authenticated either via their login or their device and can come back to their annotation by using the same device or by logging in and connecting the invitation with their KoALa-Account. Use case is a meeting of people from different institutions e.g. in Seminars etc.
 
### 3. You don't know the participants (e.g. a bigger crowd or audience)
You can also generate a number of unique invitations. (For usage in concerts e.g.)
